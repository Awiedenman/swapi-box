Have you ever wished that you can compare all of your favorite Star Wars characters, vehicles, and planets using one convenient application?  Then wait no longer!  SWAPI-box allows you to choose and store your favorites and keep track of them to look at later.

During this project we utilized the StarWars API to practice fetching information.  In addition to making api calls, we practiced working in React and testing it.
